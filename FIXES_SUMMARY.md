# CSP Website Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication System
**Problem**: Students couldn't authenticate properly, admin login was working but student logins were failing.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed JWT middleware to handle token validation more robustly
- Improved error handling in authentication routes
- Added case-insensitive username lookup for login
- Fixed User model email constraint issues
- Created proper test users with correct password hashing
- Enhanced AuthContext to handle session expiry better

**Test Credentials Created**:
- Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
- Students: `student1` / `password123`, `student2` / `password123`, `john` / `john123`, `jane` / `jane123`

### 2. Groups System
**Problem**: Students couldn't fetch available groups due to authentication failures.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed authentication middleware in groups routes
- Improved error handling for group operations
- Created test groups for students to join
- Enhanced group listing with proper member information

**Test Groups Created**:
- Study Group A (General study group)
- Programming Club (Coding and development)
- Career Guidance (Professional development)
- Project Team (Collaborative projects)

### 3. Weeks Screen Components
**Problem**: Images and PDF viewer were failing to load properly.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Completely rewrote WeekView component with better error handling
- Added image loading states and error recovery
- Improved PDF and PPT viewer components
- Enhanced GridFS file streaming with proper CORS headers
- Added loading spinners and retry mechanisms
- Fixed image gallery modal functionality

### 4. Data Loading Issues
**Problem**: General data loading failures across the application.

**Fixes Applied**:
