# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CSP (Computer Science Program) website is a comprehensive MERN stack application that serves as a platform for students and administrators to access weekly program data, participate in group discussions, and interact with an AI chatbot for guidance. The system integrates with MongoDB Atlas using GridFS for file storage, includes a Gemini/AskAI chatbot pipeline, and supports group-based communication features. The application needs to be fully functional, tested, and deployment-ready on Vercel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view weekly program data with photos, summaries, and documents, so that I can access all course materials in one organized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the weekly visits section THEN the system SHALL display all 5 weeks of data retrieved from MongoDB GridFS
2. WHEN a user selects a specific week THEN the system SHALL display the photo gallery, summary text, and any associated PPT/PDF documents for that week
3. WHEN a user clicks on a document THEN the system SHALL stream the file from GridFS and display it in an appropriate viewer
4. IF a week contains images THEN the system SHALL display them in a responsive photo gallery format
5. WHEN the system retrieves week data THEN it SHALL handle any missing or corrupted GridFS references gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to interact with an AI chatbot that provides contextual responses, so that I can get meaningful guidance and answers to my questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message to the chatbot THEN the system SHALL process the request through the Gemini/AskAI API and return a contextual response
2. WHEN the chatbot receives a question THEN it SHALL NOT provide generic or repetitive answers but instead generate relevant, specific responses
3. WHEN a user accesses the chatbot full view THEN the system SHALL display a complete chat interface with message history
4. IF the AI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and suggest trying again later
5. WHEN multiple users interact with the chatbot THEN each session SHALL maintain independent conversation context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create and manage groups with student members, so that I can facilitate organized discussions and communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a new group THEN the system SHALL store the group information in MongoDB with a unique identifier
2. WHEN an admin adds members to a group THEN the system SHALL associate those users with the group and grant them access
3. WHEN an admin views groups THEN the system SHALL display all created groups with member counts and recent activity
4. IF a group reaches maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL prevent additional members from joining
5. WHEN an admin deletes a group THEN the system SHALL remove all associated messages and member associations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to join available groups and participate in group chats, so that I can collaborate and communicate with other students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student views available groups THEN the system SHALL display only groups they are eligible to join
2. WHEN a student clicks join on a group THEN the system SHALL add them as a member and grant chat access
3. WHEN a student sends a message in a group chat THEN the system SHALL store the message in MongoDB and display it to all group members
4. WHEN a student views a group chat THEN the system SHALL display all messages in chronological order with sender information
5. IF a student is not a member of a group THEN the system SHALL NOT allow them to view or send messages in that group

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access career guidance materials through a dedicated section, so that I can view professional development resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the career guidance section THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display the career guidance PPT from GridFS
2. WHEN the career guidance document loads THEN the system SHALL display it in an appropriate presentation viewer
3. IF the career guidance file is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an error message with alternative access instructions
4. WHEN a user interacts with the presentation THEN they SHALL be able to navigate through slides and zoom as needed
5. WHEN the presentation loads THEN the system SHALL ensure proper formatting and readability across different devices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive backend API endpoints, so that the frontend can reliably access all necessary data and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests weeks data THEN the `/api/gridfs-weeks` endpoint SHALL return all week information with proper GridFS references
2. WHEN a file is requested by GridFS ID THEN the `/api/gridfs-weeks/file/:id` endpoint SHALL stream the file with appropriate headers
3. WHEN group operations are performed THEN the `/api/groups` endpoints SHALL handle creation, member management, and message operations
4. WHEN chatbot interactions occur THEN the `/api/chatbot` endpoint SHALL process messages and return AI-generated responses
5. IF any API endpoint encounters an error THEN it SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be fully tested and deployment-ready, so that it can be reliably hosted and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component tests are run THEN all React components SHALL pass their unit tests with proper coverage
2. WHEN backend tests are executed THEN all API endpoints, MongoDB models, and GridFS operations SHALL pass integration tests
3. WHEN end-to-end tests are performed THEN user workflows for viewing weeks, joining groups, and chatbot interaction SHALL complete successfully
4. WHEN the application is built for production THEN it SHALL compile without errors and be optimized for deployment
5. WHEN deployed to Vercel THEN all features SHALL function correctly with proper environment variable configuration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive navigation interface, so that I can easily access all sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the application THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with navigation options for Career Guidance, Weekly Visits, Groups, and Chatbot Full View
2. WHEN a user clicks on a navigation item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate section without page refresh
3. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile devices THEN the navigation SHALL adapt to a mobile-friendly format
4. IF a user lacks permissions for a section THEN the navigation SHALL either hide the option or display appropriate access restrictions
5. WHEN a user navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL maintain application state and user session information
