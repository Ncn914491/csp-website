    title: 'Week 1 - Gaigolupadu Government School & Ananda Nilayam Boys Hostel',
    description: `Our community service project commenced on 11th July 2025 at Gaigolupadu Government School, with the primary aim of fostering interaction, understanding student aspirations, and introducing the objectives of the career guidance program. A digital television was utilized to display a PowerPoint presentation featuring structured career roadmap diagrams. This visual aid helped maintain student engagement and clearly illustrated the various pathways available after Class 10. After introducing ourselves, we explained the purpose of our visit. Initial student questions such as “Why are you here?” and “Why should we think about this now?” provided an opportunity to highlight the importance of early career planning and making informed decisions after 10th grade. As part of our Community Service Project, our team visited Gaigolupadu Government School on 11th July 2025 to conduct a Career Guidance Session. The main goal was to create awareness among students about the importance of higher education and career planning at an early stage. We obtained prior permission from the Head Master and conducted individual sessions for Class 8 and Class 9 students in the afternoon. Each session lasted approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. We began each session by introducing ourselves and explaining the purpose of the session. We interacted with the students in a friendly manner to encourage open communication. The following topics were covered: What is a Career? Explained in simple terms what a career means and how it differs from just getting a job. Why Start Planning Now? Students were informed about the importance of early planning for their future and how decisions made during school years can influence their paths ahead. Importance of Higher Education Discussed how higher education opens doors to more opportunities, better life standards, and helps develop valuable knowledge and skills. Session Motto The main motto of the session was to encourage students to aim high and take timely steps towards their aspirations. After the initial discussion, we invited students to: Share their future goals Speak about the professions they are interested in Ask any doubts related to career planning or education We received enthusiastic responses. Some of the goals students shared included becoming a doctor, IAS officer, police officer, agriculture scientist, government teacher, and master chef. We interacted with them further, asking fun and thought-provoking questions to maintain interest and make the session lively.`,

    title: 'Week 2 - Gaigolupadu Government School',
    description: `Week 2 of our Career Guidance Program was conducted on 17th and 18th July 2025 at Gaigolupadu Government School. Our objective was to provide in-depth awareness about specific career paths, their significance, eligibility, and suitability based on student interests. We designed each session to be interactive, structured, and inspiring. On Day 1, we focused on Engineering and Medical careers. We explained that to become an engineer, students usually pursue the MPC stream in Intermediate, followed by qualifying exams such as JEE, EAMCET, or other state-level engineering entrance exams. Engineering offers various branches such as Computer Science, Mechanical, Civil, and Electrical and Electronics Engineering. We also discussed who should choose engineering as a career. For Medical and Health Sciences, we explained that to pursue medical careers, students take the BiPC stream in Intermediate and appear for NEET (National Eligibility Entrance Test). Based on performance, they may choose MBBS, BDS, BPT, or BSc Nursing. We also discussed who should choose medical fields. On Day 2, we focused on Government Jobs, Law, Sports, Entrepreneurship, and a Final Review. We explained that government jobs are highly valued for their stability, benefits, and social impact. We explained that students can prepare for them through specific competitive exams depending on the role. We also discussed careers in Law, Sports, and Entrepreneurship. In the final part of the session, we invited open questions. Some of them included: “Can I become a chef or dancer if I’m not good in studies?”, “Is it okay to choose business over government jobs?”, and “How do I train for the army or police while still in school?”. We encouraged students to believe in their unique paths. We shared that every dream, whether academic or skill-based, is valid and achievable with discipline and guidance.`,

    title: 'Week 3 - Sanjeev Synergy School',
    description: `Week 3 of our Community Service Project extended the career guidance initiative to Sanjeev Synergy School, where we engaged with students from Classes 6 to 8. Unlike our previous sessions with higher classes and digital resources, this school lacked such an infrastructure. However, the absence of smart boards or projectors became an opportunity to adopt a more storytelling and activity-based approach that matched the comprehension levels of younger students. The objectives for Week 3 were to: Encourage early career curiosity among middle schoolers. Help students understand the role of education in achieving goals. Inspire students with stories and examples from real life. Actively interact through drawing, discussion, role play, and Q&A. On Day 1, we began the sessions with a warm and cheerful self-introduction. To connect with the younger audience, we asked fun and imaginative questions such as: “If you could be anyone in the world, who would you be?” and “What do you want to be when you grow up?”. The responses were full of energy, some common responses were teacher, police officer, doctor, cricketer, singer, and pilot. Some students surprised us with creative ideas like YouTuber, astronaut, and fashion designer. We simplified the concept of a career as “what you want to be when you grow up and how you help others.” We used simple examples and cartoons to show how dreamers become achievers. Each student was given paper and colors to draw their dream job. This was an effective way to let them express their ambitions non-verbally. To keep students focused, we used storytelling. For example: The story of a poor boy who became a scientist (inspired by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam). The story of a boy who repaired old radios and later became one of India’s top engineers. A girl who loved painting and eventually became a famous illustrator for children’s books. On Day 2, we focused on showing students the path from school to career, using charts and physical gestures for visualization. We discussed why school is important, role models around us, and respecting all careers. The sessions were entirely focused on listening to students, understanding their aspirations, and guiding them through conversations. Students were encouraged to talk about their dreams, ask questions, and share what careers they found interesting or inspiring.`,

    title: 'Week 4 - Municipal Corporation High School, Kondayya Palem',
    description: `As part of the Community Service Project under JNTUK, our team from the Department of Computer Science conducted a two-day career guidance session for Class 9 students at Municipal Corporation High School, Kondayya Palem, Kakinada on 1st and 2nd August 2025. The main objective of this program was to bridge the gap between student curiosity and career awareness. Our team aimed to: Introduce students to multiple career pathways after 10th class. Share personal experiences as engineering students. Simplify concepts related to Intermediate, Polytechnic, and other streams. Encourage confidence through Q&A and direct interaction. On Day 1, the first day began with a warm introduction and a quick interaction to understand students’ aspirations. Using a smartboard presentation, we discussed: Intermediate Paths: MPC, BiPC, MEC, CEC and Polytechnic Stream: 3-year diploma and lateral entry into B.Tech. We also discussed Engineering Fields like Computer Science, Civil, Mechanical, ECE and Medical Fields like MBBS, BDS, Nursing, BPT. We explained entrance exams like EAMCET, NEET, and Polytechnic entrance, and gave tips for planning early. Students responded positively and asked questions like: “Can I become an engineer without studying MPC?” and “How many marks do we need for polytechnic?”. On Day 2, we went beyond traditional career options and introduced students to alternative and emerging careers. Topics included: Government Sector: SSC, Police, RRB, UPSC, State Services, Vocational and Technical Careers: Electrician, Tailoring, Mobile Repair, Beautician, and ITI-based courses, Entrepreneurship: Starting a business, freelancing, or online services like YouTube or teaching, and Sports & Law: BPED, Coaching, CLAT, and Law Education. Students asked thoughtful questions like: “Can I get a job without becoming an engineer or doctor?” and “Can girls become pilots or police officers?”.`,
